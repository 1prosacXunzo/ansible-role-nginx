- To edit your map, you can use various tools and options available in different tabs. For example, you can use the "Terrain Sculpting" tool in the "Terrain" tab to modify the relief of your map. You can use the "Ground Textures" tool in the same tab to paint different materials on your map. You can use the "Environment Settings" tool in the "Environment" tab to change the sky color, water settings, particles, etc.
- To save your map, click on the "Save Level As..." button at the top and choose a name and a location for your .lvl file. You can also export your map as a .pak file using the "Export Level As..." button. This will create a .pak file that contains all your map data and resources.
- To share your map with other players, you need to upload your .pak file to Steam Workshop using the "Publish Level To Workshop..." button at the top. You can also browse and download other players' maps from Steam Workshop using the "Browse Workshop Levels..." button.
